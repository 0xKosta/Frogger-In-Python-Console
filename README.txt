(DOES NOT CURRENTLY WORK PROPERLY ON LINUX! ONLY SUPPORTED ON WINDOWS)

To run this, you must have the python keyboard module.
You can install it with the following command:

pip install keyboard

or by cloning the repo:

git clone https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard

NOTE:
The game is pretty buggy, as it runs on the console and uses barebones python.
Avoid if you have a severe kind of epilepsy, as the game flickers a bit, due to the way it's rendered.
I will be adding more enemies, as well as level editors.
